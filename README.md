# Sonus7
  Sonus7 is an analog seven-band spectrum bargraph with op amps. It consists of seven VU-meters, each being fed with a bandpass filter and peak detector circuit. 
  
  Each band has a width of 1.25 octaves. The bands are: 63 Hz, 160 Hz, 400 Hz, 1.25 kHz, 2.5 kHz, 6.25 kHz, 16 kHz. 
  
  The filters are second-order Multiple Feedback bandpass filters using TLC272 opamps. The VU-meters consist of a logaritmic comparator array, also using TLC272 opamps.
